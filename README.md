# LoLysis

This proyect provides data analysis related to the videogame League Of Legends (LoL) using the public [RiotAPI](https://developer.riotgames.com/apis)

The real aim of the proyect is purely self development in some modern software development technologies like React, Vite, etc... I will also try
to keep good code quality while the proyect goes on (clean code, standards, testing...)
